## ✨ Features That Go Way Beyond "Just a Double Jump"

✅ **Not native to Minecraft? No problem.**  
We *rewrote physics* to make smooth, fully customizable double jumps possible.

✅ **Jump Blocks – Step to Launch**  
Step on a block (e.g. `DIAMOND_BLOCK`) and instantly unlock your jump.  
Fully customizable triggers, messages, and permissions.

✅ **Jump Items – Your Jump, Your Style**  
Require players to:
- Wear special boots (`WEAR_ITEM`)
- Hold a specific item (`HOLD_ITEM`)
- Right-click it (`CLICK_ITEM`)  
  *Every action fully configurable.*

‍🎨 **Jump Visuals – Particles & Sounds, Player-Controlled**  
- Built-in GUI lets players pick their own particles and sounds.  
- Set defaults in config
- Players can override them freely

✅ **Permission-Based Power**  
Control velocity, cooldown, and access using permissions — ideal for rank systems.

✅ **Fall Damage Control**  
- Turn OFF for fun parkour  
- Turn ON for PvP challenge  
*Your server, your rules.*

✅ **Smart Restrictions**   
Block double jumps:
- ❌ For laggy players
- 🛑 When Elytra is equipped
- 🌍 In WorldGuard regions
- 🌐 In specific worlds
- 👥 Or allow only via permissions

⏱️ **Jump Delay System**  
Limit jump use to every X seconds. No more spam-jumping across your map.

🔄 **Auto Enable on Join**
- For all players
- Or only VIPs (via permission)

⚡ **Performance-First Engine**  
We bent Minecraft’s physics to our will — with **zero performance hit**.

🔧 **100% Configurable**  
Messages, mechanics, behavior — everything is in your control.
